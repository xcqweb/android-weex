在性能方面的表现也是非常优异的，尤其是界面首屏加载时间、native 下长列表的资源开销和复用、CPU、内存、帧率等关键指标。当然，尽管 Weex 已经提供了一组开发者最常用的组件和模块，但面对丰富多样的移动应用研发需求，这些常用基础组件还是远远不够的，因此我们提供了灵活自由的能力扩展方式，开发者可以根据自身的情况定制属于自己的客户端组件和模块，进一步丰富 Weex 在客户端上的能力。\\n\\n相关链接\\n\\nWeex 的组件和模块跟 web 标准的区别\\n如何使用 iOS\\n如何使用 Android\\n如何扩展 iOS\\n如何扩展 Android\\n浏览器渲染\\nWeex 除了提供 iOS 和 Android 的客户端渲染层之外，还基于 Vue 2.0 对官方的所有组件和模块进行了 web 封装，开发者可以基于 Vue 2.0 用同一套源代码构建出在浏览器中相同效果的页面。并且同样可以横向扩展。\")]), _vm._v(\" \"), _c('p', {\n    staticClass: \"btn weex-el weex-text\",\n    attrs: {\n      \"weex-type\": \"text\",\n      \"data-evt-click\": \"\"\n    },\n
